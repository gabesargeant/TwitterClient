    <h1>These are <em>The Rules</em> to this Twitter Game...</h1>
    <h3>Its like orienteering...</h3>
</header>
<em>Seriously, it takes minimal effort and it may help you get that 10,000 steps</em>

<p><h2>To Start a Game</h2>
<p>Tweet <em>start game</em> to <strong><em>@gonzo4111</em></strong> with your <em>exact location (lat, long)</em>  and the bot should respond right away!
<p>You'll get a response in about 1 - 5 minutes. It will be a Tweet to your account that will contain a link to a map.
<p>Like this....
<p><a href="https://d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html?long0=144.9621474&lat0=-37.8121507&dist0=534.72915564&162146238">d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html?long0=144.9621474&lat0=-37.8121507&dist0=534.72915564&16214623</a>
<p>If you look at the web address you'll see dist0=123.456. This is how far in meters you are from where you need to be.
<p>So make an educated guess and get somewhere.

<p><h2>To find out if you're close</h2>
<p><em>tweet: @gonzo4111 ping.</em>
Make sure you tweet the word ping and direct it at <stonrg>@</stonrg> the bot!
<p>You'll get another map with your new and previous locations.
<p><a href="https://d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html?long0=144.9657171&lat0=-37.8075613&dist0=1130.655109518&long1=144.9621474&lat1=-37.8121507&dist1=534.72915564&2093730176">d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html.....</a>
<p>You may have been way off....
<p>Keep moving, keep looking and keep tweeting ping.
<p><a href="https://d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html?long0=144.9586407&lat0=-37.8166246&dist0=94.706041705&long1=144.9657171&lat1=-37.8075613&dist1=1130.655109518&long2=144.9621474&lat2=-37.8121507&dist2=534.72915564&1750133638">ping</a>
<p><a href="https://d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html?long0=144.959772&lat0=-37.8166076&dist0=159.961624014&long1=144.9586407&lat1=-37.8166246&dist1=94.706041705&long2=144.9657171&lat2=-37.8075613&dist2=1130.655109518&-862217233">ping</a>
<p><a href="https://d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html?long0=144.9581677&lat0=-37.815675&dist0=18.795013459&long1=144.959772&lat1=-37.8166076&dist1=159.961624014&long2=144.9586407&lat2=-37.8166246&dist2=94.706041705&-1480746311">ping</a>
<p>You'll get a max history of your three last pings on any map. The green dot is where you are, yellow is before that and so on.
<p><h2>Had enough?</h2>
<p><em>Tweet quit.....</em> That's it, game over.
<p>Otherwise keep looking and <em>when you're within 15m </em><a href="https://d13dlmp0uwngbc.cloudfront.net/loc.html?long0=144.9582562&lat0=-37.815875&dist0=4.771425745&long1=144.9581677&lat1=-37.815675&dist1=18.795013459&long2=144.959772&lat2=-37.8166076&dist2=159.961624014&">you're done!</a>
<p>You'll get notified you've won and the game will be over.
<p>Also, don't mind any random digits that are on the tail of any tweets, it's just to avoid the double tweet issue.
<p><h2>Questions?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What are the circles? </li>
       <i> They are the distance between you and the point you're after. You're at the center of the circle and the point could be anywhere on its circumference. </i>
    <li>So when I have two circles overlapping, there are two areas the point could be?</li>
        <i>Yes.</i>
    <li>I tweeted my exact location but I got directed back here?</li>
        <i>Have a look at your twitter settings under privacy. The location differs slightly between iPhone and Android etc. But you want to enable gps for this game to play.</i>
    <li>Do I win anything?</li>
        <i>No. At this point in time it's a solo game to give me a bit of a play with a few features of mysql, java, and aws.</i>
    <li>Why did you make this?</li>
        <i>Why not.</i>
    <li>So why use twitter and not make your own service?</li>
        <i>That's next.</i>

</ul>
