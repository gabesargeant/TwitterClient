Hoi hoi, 

If your reading this, any terrible anit-patterns for heinous coding styles are merely me 
trying to deponstrate not what to do :p

This a twitter client based off the Twitter4j libraries and some mysql features. 

See twitter4j.org for more info on that component.

Read rules.html to pick up the method of gameplay.

This 'app'  was made mostly to have a look at the spatial features that mysql 5.7 offer. 
At the time of this being commited I had this app running on AWS ec2 micro listening againts
a username for updates. 

Testing has been done with a mock location service that provided gps coords without me moving 
away from my desk.

JavaFX, I had initally build a gui app to mock data into the database and to ping twitter, 
This gui got cut back as the application took shape.
